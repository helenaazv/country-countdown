# üåç Country Countdown üåç
Country Countdown is a React Native quiz game where players test their geography knowledge by naming as many countries as possible within 15 minutes. The game uses real-time data, stores the best score locally, and features a playful animated globe and custom fonts. 

This app is the first in a collection of geography games I hope to build and eventually combine into one interactive learning experience.

Made with love inspired by the memory of guessing countries with my mom on the way to school.
